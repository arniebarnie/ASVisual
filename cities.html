        <h2>The Impact of Automobiles on the Layout of Cities</h2>
        <p>The proliferation of automobiles, starting with the Ford Model T, and the mobility it gave
        the average American had a major impact on the development of American cities.</p>

          As automobiles increasingly vied for space in the city, they clashed with more traditional modes of transportation
          on the city street and so, society had to make a decision on who owned the street. Although automobile traffic
          increased dramatically, almost exponentially, throughout the first fifth of the twentieth century, the question
          of who had control of the street was not decided till the 1930s. This lack of ownership fostered an intense
          rivalry between pedestrians and drivers who referred to the other as “joy riders” and “jaywalkers” respectively.
          By the 1930s, a “new street equilibrium based on automobile supremacy” (Norton) was achieved and most pedestrians
          relinquished the streets thanks to new traffic and safety regulations.

      <h3>Growth of Parking Lots</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-5">
        <p>
          This surge in car ownership has led to parking lots now taking up over one-third of all land area in some American cities.
          In fact, according Curbed, “in the city of Los Angeles, any new building with more than three units must
          have its own full-sized, dedicated parking space for each unit, adding about 375 square feet per unit to the
          project” (Walker). Many have argued, including Donald Shoup who is a UCLA urban planning professor, that these
          parking minimums are a major contributing factor for the city’s housing crisis as many developers need to add
          floors or dig underground to add parking space which can get very expensive. LA is not the only place with
          parking minimums and even more examples of its damaging effects can be found elsewhere.
