        <p>Currently, motorized transport makes up roughly a quarter, 6.8 gigations, of greenhouse emmisions
        , and this number is only expected to rise. According to a government report mandated by the Global
        Change Research Act of 1990, "global annually averaged surface air temperature has increased by 1.8
        &deg;F (1.0&deg;C) over the last 115 years" (Wuebbles) and has made this "the warmest in the history
        of modern civilization" (Wuebbles).</p>

      <h3>The Effect on Americans</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <p>These changes to the environment have even had significant economic and cultural effects on some Americans. For example, fishing in New England and the Mid-Atlantic has been associated with bottom-dwelling fish for more than 400 years, and is a central part of the region’s cultural identity and social fabric. The fishing vessels of this region “use home ports in more than 100 coastal communities from Maine to New Jersey, and the landed value from fisheries in New England and the Mid-Atlantic in 2010 was nearly $1.2 billion. Captains and crew are often second- or third-generation fishermen who learned the trade from their families” (Melillo 566). Sadly, since 1982, sea temperatures in this region have rapidly rose thanks to climate change and caused a massive migration of many fish species to the north in search of colder water and have put the livelihoods of many fishermen and of their communities in jeopardy, especially in southern states like New Jersey. Although “larger fishing boats can follow the fish to a certain extent as they shift northward, smaller inshore boats will be more likely to leave fishing” (Melillo 566). Climate change has decimated many small fishing communities across the eastern seaboard as they now fight for their survival thanks to the migration of so many fish species.
