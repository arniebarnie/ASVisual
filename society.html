          As people left cities and moved into suburbs, the social environment in which they lived in also profoundly
          changed. According to the experiences of Andrew Price, who has lived in both cities and suburbs, there are
          major differences in the environments of these places. When he lived in a city, “[he] used to have random
          encounters with strangers, often daily. These were usually nothing more than simple interruptions. The elderly
          lady that asks for help at the train station … so these random encounters played an important part in
          developing [his] social skills and feeling comfortable around strangers” (Price) and while living in the
          suburbs, “[he] eliminated most of these random encounters” (Price). The social interactions between people in
          cities and suburbs is quite different and the distance between people in suburbs has caused a large amount of
          isolation.

          The role of women in society was also profoundly impacted by the mass adoption of the car. “The urban
          housewife of 1925 who could do well without a car was transformed into the the suburban housewife of 1960
          who required a car to do all of her shopping or to pick up the kids after school” (Hess 9). With the use of
          cars by women, they were no longer limited to the house and could escape their normal jobs at home and go
          into the “cultural scene” (Hess 9). Now, women’s work was no longer limited to domestic duties and they
          could enter the male-dominated job market. In this regard, women achieved new levels of equality with men
          thanks to the automobile.
